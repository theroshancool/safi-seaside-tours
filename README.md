# 🌊 Safi Seaside Tours – Frontend Project

A responsive, multi-page tourism website built for **Safi Seaside Tours**, a private tour company based in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
This project was developed as part of a creative assignment for **Devlofox Technologies**, focusing on design sense, structure, and user experience.

## 🧭 Project Overview

**Safi Seaside Tours** offers private and small-group tours across Nova Scotia — from Peggy’s Cove to Lunenburg.
The website showcases key travel packages, allows users to send booking requests, and reflects a professional coastal theme.

## 🧩 Future Scope (Backend Architecture & Scalability Plan)

Although this submission focuses on the **frontend (HTML, CSS, JS)** part, the design is **backend-ready** for seamless future expansion.

### Proposed Full-Stack Architecture

```
Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS)
       │
       ▼
Express.js REST API
 ├── Tours API
 ├── Bookings API
 ├── Contact API
 └── Auth API
       │
       ▼
PostgreSQL Database
```

### 🧱 Tech Plan

| Layer                    | Technology                                              | Description                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Framework**            | Express.js (Node.js)                                    | REST API for tours, bookings, and authentication |
| **Database**             | PostgreSQL (via Prisma / Sequelize ORM)                 | Scalable relational data storage                 |
| **Auth System**          | JWT-based authentication                                | Secure admin and API access                      |
| **Mail Service**         | Nodemailer                                              | Automated booking & inquiry emails               |
| **Cache Layer (Future)** | Redis                                                   | Faster data access and reduced DB load           |
| **Deployment**           | Render / Railway (Backend), Vercel / Netlify (Frontend) | CI/CD-friendly modern cloud deployment           |
